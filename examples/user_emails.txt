Hey Nina,

Appreciate you sending over the updated slides. I went through them this morning and added a few comments—mainly around clarity in the metrics section. Let me know what you think.

Happy to hop on a quick call if that’s easier.

Best,

Subject: Heads-up: Billing update from Platform X
Body:
Hi Ahmed,

Just a quick note—Platform X is rolling out a change to how they bill for data pulls starting next quarter. Previously, anything under 10K rows was included; that’s no longer the case.

We’re not over the threshold yet, but worth flagging in case usage scales up. Let me know if you want to loop in finance for projections.

Best,
Josh

Hey Lillian,

Really liked the new onboarding doc—especially the way you broke out the platform nuances. One suggestion: maybe we flag the data sync caveats right up front (that came up with Nina’s team last week).

If helpful, I can drop in a few notes from our last two onboarding sessions. Just let me know.

Thanks again for pulling this together.

Josh
